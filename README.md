# üè° Airbnb Price Prediction ‚Äì Random Forest Regression

This project was developed as part of **Lab 8: Define and Solve an ML Problem** in the Break Through Tech AI / eCornell Machine Learning Certificate. It follows the full ML lifecycle, from problem definition and data preparation to modeling, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using the **Airbnb NYC Listings** dataset to predict Airbnb listing prices.

## üìä Problem Statement

**Objective**: Predict the `price` of an Airbnb listing based on host and listing features.  
**ML Task**: Supervised Regression  
**Target Variable**: `price`  
**Impact**: Helping Airbnb hosts set fair, competitive prices that maximize revenue while improving user satisfaction and booking conversion rates.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Dataset: `airbnbListingsData.csv` (NYC listings with host and listing metadata)
- Size: 28,000+ rows √ó 50 columns
- Features include:
  - Host responsiveness and verification
  - Room type and accommodation details
